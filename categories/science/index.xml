      <description>These are my notes taken in the Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning course by the University of Alberta in Coursera, part of their Reinforcement Learning Specialization. It is a very interesting framework of learning not only because it is very game-like, but because it helps modeling the world when you want to be able learn from sequences of interactions which progressively expand the model of the world and the actors in it, differing a lot from traditional supervised and unsupervised learning.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve completed the Data-Driven Astronomy course by the University of Sydney in Coursera. It is a very interesting course because it mixes something I really like which is Astronomy, and my recently inspired interest of learning about Data Science and Machine Learning.
In Astronomy, there&amp;rsquo;s tons of data captured by multiple instruments and experiments, which is sometimes hard to parse or extract meaningful conclusions out of them by hand, which makes technologies that can process vast volumes of data and also learn from them highly valuable.</description>

      <title>Those Starry Nights</title>

      <description>Some members of the Veil Nebula Group at Santa FÃ© de Antioquia, or at least close to there. Its a very colonial town with mountains close to it, where several people have vacation houses. One particular thing about the place is that since its a small town and far from the main cities, there are no city lights in several dozens of kilometers, so the sky is kinda nice for amateur astronomy.</description>

      <title>7, 2, 1</title>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by the numbers 7, 2 and 1 quite a lot. Really. Also any of the multiples of seven, but not so much as seven itself and twenty-one, and the digits of that number, two and one, and then any number with a digits combination of seven, two, and one, for example 721.
One day in school I was doing some math in my calculator, and needed the result of the 84&amp;frasl;66 fraction.</description>

      <title>Ad Infinitum</title>

      <description>A grid full of individual cells. Each with a color value chosen at random. Overall, there are 12 different colors that wrap around.
Suddenly, each cell becomes a prey, its hunter, is the &amp;lsquo;next&amp;rsquo; color in the rules:
1 -&amp;gt; 2 / 2 -&amp;gt; 3 / n -&amp;gt; n+1 / 12 -&amp;gt; 1
If everything goes according to the plan, a curious linear and cyclical pattern is formed. But then, once in a while, rules change, and chaos appears.</description>

      <description>For all those Fractal Hearts
Convoluted, and complex
No matter how deep, full of detail
The intrinsic shape of The Universe
I this is a simulation in C++ with SFML 2.0. Every frame is a Julia Set fractal rendered with a slightly varying initial parameter, so it gives the illusion that its evolving. The first strategy for varying the initial parameter is like a row by row scan of points of the complex plane from the uppermost left corner down the the lowermost right corner.</description>
