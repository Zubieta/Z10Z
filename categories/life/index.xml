      <title>Seven Years Pt. III</title>

      <description>You know, one thing that human society as a whole can agree with, is that 2020 has been awful, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to explain all the reasons why.
I have been &amp;ldquo;working from home&amp;rdquo; since March. Some people would think that being able to completely work from home is cool, but not necessarily. Even people who are full-time remote workers need some space and time to go out, interact with friends, go to a restaurant, go to a movie, etc, many things that given the circumstances I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to do as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>These are my notes taken in the Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning course by the University of Alberta in Coursera, part of their Reinforcement Learning Specialization. It is a very interesting framework of learning not only because it is very game-like, but because it helps modeling the world when you want to be able learn from sequences of interactions which progressively expand the model of the world and the actors in it, differing a lot from traditional supervised and unsupervised learning.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Starting is easy, persistence is an art&amp;rdquo;
For a long time in my life, I just went with the current, taking whatever opportunities came available, but without much of an overarching goal and a plan to reach it. This changed last year with this deep discussion about things seven years in the future, which planted in my head the idea of seeking an ultimate goal, or at least find myself such a goal.</description>

      <description>It was during a sort of deep talk at lunch with my teammates, that I had a deep discussion with Hadi about the future. I talked about the goals I wanted to reach, all the things I wanted to learn, but how far away or out of reach they seemed. He then told me something like
&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s see in seven years where are you at&amp;rdquo;
It was something like a challenge and at the same time a promise, an expectation, a motivation.</description>

      <description>After my second internship at Google, and the months-long very convoluted conversion process that followed with a lot of back and forth that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be going anywhere, I decided that it was enough and started looking for new opportunities.
I applied to many companies, but there was one that went through the whole process, and it was Booking.com.
The process was surprisingly fast, from the moment I had my on-site interviews until the moment I started working, it was only 4 months.</description>

      <title>Internship(s) at Google</title>

      <description>Today I got accepted for an Internship at Google this summer! This is so crazy.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet come back to my senses. There&amp;rsquo;s so much I want to write regarding this, mostly about the process so far, which started on September 12th (exactly 5 months ago!), specifically because there&amp;rsquo;s some people in my university afraid or unsure of applying (even if university recruiters try to motivate people to do so), so I believe a personal account of my process so far (regarding applying, the interviews, process structure, etc) would be really useful and motivating for some people I know (and perhaps some others I don&amp;rsquo;t, which still may find this interesting).</description>

      <title>Motivation Vs Discipline</title>

      <description>‘Motivation may get you to take on a task or behavior that you don’t normally do but eventually that motivation will either not be there any more or won’t be effective.’
&amp;lsquo;I think many of us have a will to overcome existing habits and form new ones but we lack the way to do so. Too many distractions, too many opportunities, too many excuses.&amp;rsquo;
’Take a look at successful people around you.</description>

      <description>This is how some Germany fans from Medellín, Colombia celebrated yesterday the triumph of the Germany National Soccer Team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup! Some of these people are of German descent, others were students from the Deutsche Schule highschool (a network of schools that exists in many countries that has a focus on teaching things from the German culture and the language), and others are simply in love with the country/team, which is my case!</description>

      <description>Some members of the Veil Nebula Group at Santa Fé de Antioquia, or at least close to there. Its a very colonial town with mountains close to it, where several people have vacation houses. One particular thing about the place is that since its a small town and far from the main cities, there are no city lights in several dozens of kilometers, so the sky is kinda nice for amateur astronomy.</description>

      <description>Some pictures I&amp;rsquo;ve taken along many years (mostly while I have been at university since 2011), years full of changes, going from thinking and doing kinda stupid stuff, to thinking and doing either kinda more rational stuff or stupider stuff heh, a whole life learning, but also, just out of pure curiosity, trying several combinations of hair styles, sometimes even cutting my own hair myself to try things. (Or sometimes experimenting odd stuff just for one day).</description>

      <description>I work as a Software Developer in a cross-functional area at an intersection of Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, and Product Development, in which I&amp;rsquo;ve supported the simultaneous development of multiple products and initiatives, and I&amp;rsquo;ve acted as a middle point between different teams in my area and across the company, with ownership and accountability for many of these projects which have an impact on hundreds of millions of users.
My daily work involves interacting with other Developers, Data Scientists, and Product Managers, understanding their needs, and expressing mine, so that I can do my best to benefit everyone, while balancing trade-offs, and having the flexibility to be ready to experiment, improvise, or react to unforeseen situations, being aware of possible changes in the priorities of tasks and goals in a rapid changing environment.</description>
