      <title>Random Pattern Generator</title>

      <description>During the boredom of staying a lot at home in 2020, I got inspiration from @infrahumano to start playing around with a certain mechanism of pattern generation, outlined in his blog post (in Spanish) https://infrahumano.github.io/exterior/2020/04/04/noche.html. After that, we started a long thread in which we went along making improvements, suggestions to each other, and a lot of experimenting seeking to make these patterns look nicer. He then made a new post with such results (in Spanish) https://infrahumano.</description>

      <description>I presented my work made on CraZe in the Processing Community Day, Amsterdam edition. It was a very interesting experience because I got to meet a booming creative coding community which I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about before, and because the things I presented were things I had been working on for years but had never properly presented to an audience.
 
This is the presentation I made. I got great feedback, questions, and most importantly the people I met were very inspiring because the great and curious things they do.</description>

      <title>CraZe On The Web</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never had some sort of online publicity strategy. Haven&amp;rsquo;t paid for publicity, my strategy has been very local, as in sharing stuff to my social circle, installing it myself to my friends&amp;rsquo; devices (who then install it to their friends and families), and sneakily opening it at random tech stores tablets, phones, and computers. Locally it&amp;rsquo;s a blast doing that, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale up. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been sure of how to go around trying to promote massively this kind of app in the online world.</description>

      <description>(Click the image to go to a web album containing several drawings that some people and myself have made with the application)
Like a long forgotten promise, from the depths of Christmas 2012 (oh, that weekend of the 7th~9th when I first did the web application), comes a brief resurrection of my psychedelic drawing app CraZe, because I once promised myself that I’d make it multi-user ~ concurrent, but jokingly thought ‘nah, seems very hard to accomplish such a thing, maybe in 90 years’.</description>

      <description>This is the most sloppy version of the intro of Muse&amp;rsquo;s song &amp;lsquo;Explorers&amp;rsquo;, played of course, by me.

This is part of my Computer Graphics class&amp;rsquo; project. It&amp;rsquo;s using the Processing programming language, the TheMidiBus library, and a KORG nanoKEY as input.
The triangle changes its size according to the pitch of the key, and the color its brighter if the key is pressed hard, if not, it will be pale in color.</description>

      <title>Playing With Processing</title>

      <description>This is an animation I did for a Computer Graphics class homework, without using any of the built in 2D/3D cartesian transformations, but the ones taught to us at class after I garnered some experience by playing around with the framework (but still only using the basic drawing functionality). Check out at GitHub, my homeworks for that class, mostly using Processing.
Its the language most of Computational Artists use nowadays to make some neat stuff, like hypnotic geometric GIFs, glitched art, interactive artistic installations using external hardware input, etc.</description>

      <description>A grid full of individual cells. Each with a color value chosen at random. Overall, there are 12 different colors that wrap around.
Suddenly, each cell becomes a prey, its hunter, is the &amp;lsquo;next&amp;rsquo; color in the rules:
1 -&amp;gt; 2 / 2 -&amp;gt; 3 / n -&amp;gt; n+1 / 12 -&amp;gt; 1
If everything goes according to the plan, a curious linear and cyclical pattern is formed. But then, once in a while, rules change, and chaos appears.</description>

      <description>For all those Fractal Hearts
Convoluted, and complex
No matter how deep, full of detail
The intrinsic shape of The Universe
I this is a simulation in C++ with SFML 2.0. Every frame is a Julia Set fractal rendered with a slightly varying initial parameter, so it gives the illusion that its evolving. The first strategy for varying the initial parameter is like a row by row scan of points of the complex plane from the uppermost left corner down the the lowermost right corner.</description>
