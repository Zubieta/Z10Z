      <description>These are my notes taken in the Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning course by the University of Alberta in Coursera. It is a very interesting framework of learning not only because it is very game-like, but because it helps modeling the world when you want to be able learn from sequences of interactions.

At work I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a Software Developer supporting Data Scientists in their creation of Reinforcement Learning models, they do the modelling and I work on the backend integration of such, data pipelines and cleanliness, etc.</description>

      <description>Some members of the Veil Nebula Group at Santa FÃ© de Antioquia, or at least close to there. Its a very colonial town with mountains close to it, where several people have vacation houses. One particular thing about the place is that since its a small town and far from the main cities, there are no city lights in several dozens of kilometers, so the sky is kinda nice for amateur astronomy.</description>

      <description>For all those Fractal Hearts
Convoluted, and complex
No matter how deep, full of detail
The intrinsic shape of The Universe
I this is a simulation in C++ with SFML 2.0. Every frame is a Julia Set fractal rendered with a slightly varying initial parameter, so it gives the illusion that its evolving. The first strategy for varying the initial parameter is like a row by row scan of points of the complex plane from the uppermost left corner down the the lowermost right corner.</description>
