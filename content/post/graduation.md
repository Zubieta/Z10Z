After 6 long, yet lightning fast years, I have graduated. The expected length of the Computer Science program in my university is 9 semesters, but I took an extra 3 semesters because I wanted to do a lot of stuff, specially doing several [internships](https://z10z.xyz/internships-at-google/). It was very much worth it, and **all the experiences I had while at university helped shaping who I am today**. Like Elvis once said,
