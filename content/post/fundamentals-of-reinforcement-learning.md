These are my notes taken in the _**Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning**_ course by the University of Alberta in Coursera. It is a very interesting framework of learning not only because it is very game-like, but because it helps modeling the world when you want to be able learn from sequences of interactions.

At work I've been working as a **Software Developer** supporting **Data Scientists** in their creation of Reinforcement Learning models, they do the modelling and I work on the backend integration of such, data pipelines and cleanliness, etc. Still, I wanted to learn more about what they were doing so I'd be able to provide the best support from my side.
