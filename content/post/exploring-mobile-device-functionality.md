I've been playing around with some pieces of technology *(an Android Tablet, an Android Phone, Apple’s Magic Keyboard/Trackpad, a MHL-Compliant TV)* which I own, and found out some functionality which I didn’t know they could perform together:

- If you have an **Android Tablet/Phone**, and if you pair a **Bluetooth Keyboard** like **Apple**'s own **Magic Keyboard**, several Apple-Specific hot keys retain their functions, like **Media Buttons** *(Play/Pause/Volume, which seems more reasonable)* and **Exposé** *(opens up the Task Manager, this one quite impressed me)*.

- If you have an **Android Tablet/Phone**, and if you pair a **Bluetooth Trackpad** like **Apple**’s own **Magic Trackpad**, not only it makes a cursor appear on screen like a traditional mouse, but also **Multitouch Gestures** done on the trackpad are identified by the device *(like, multi-finger gestures, and showing one circular cursor for each finger on the trackpad as if they were on the screen)*.

*(I think that with iOS Devices you can pair the Magic Keyboard, or any Bluetooth Keyboard for the matter, but not the Trackpad, Apple seems to be a bit allergic about having a Cursor on Touch Devices, even if its neat for TV-out and not having to be stuck in front of the TV, and their very own Magic Trackpad would allow people to perform Multi-Touch gestures from afar. Its very strange that Android devices support the full Magic Trackpad functionality, and Apple's own iOS devices support none).*

- If you have a **MHL-Enabled TV**, chances are that when you connect a device like an **Android Tablet/Phone** via HDMI *(I guess it counts for any device that’s MHL Compliant)*, you can control that device using the TV’s own remove control. So, with my TV remote I can use the arrows to navigate around and also the Media Buttons *(Play/Pause/Stop)* to control music/movies that are playing on the device, making any tablet/phone into a potential media center for the *(MHL-Enabled)* TV without needing to buy any kind of external device to control the device from afar.

Thats it for now, I'll update this in case I find out any further functionality in my devices that I was not aware they could perform when I bought them, its sometimes nice to be surprised by what some pieces of technology can do!
