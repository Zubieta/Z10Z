There's things I’ve said **I’d not want**, or **never do**, or **never be**, and saw such things as negative, and nonetheless I've ended up **wanting**, **doing**, or **becoming** many of them.

*‘I’d **never** study at ____ , such an shallow place’*  
*'I’d **never** stop talking with ____ , it means a lot to me’*  
*'I’d **never** put ____ before ____ , its a matter of principles’*  
*'I’d **never** want to learn about ____ , or stuff related to it’*  
*'I’d **never** become like ____ , it gets on my nerves'*  
*'I'd **never** dedicate myself to ____, such an meaningless way of life'*  
*'I'd **never** like anyone that isn't ____'*

*And many others mental statements like that...*  

Then there's the things I’ve wanted to pursue, or thought to myself that I must want, do, or become, which are the things I ended up myself achieving the less, or not at all. For some reason it was apparently more probable for me to get to something I say I must not, or rather not, than getting to something I say I must or I want to.

Then I came to the realization that some of the things I’ve said **'not’** to before, were part of how I really was, or am, things I had forgotten that were part of what defined myself, but no matter how much I tried fighting against them, I'd end up drawn back to them.

Such thoughts, lifestyles, ways of acting and doing things, **that were the most like myself**, started being eroded away by some **external pressures** *(such as being labeled an outcast, and also the fear of not living up to the expectations many people has in myself)*, some stupid or broken **moral or social imperatives** *(like, you must be this way if you ever want to amount to anything)*, and some stupid desire of **wanting to live the lives of others and not my own** *(as in, trying to live, act and work the way the people I admired lived, acted and worked, because I thought that by doing so I'd achieve the success for which I admired them, that it would be easier following their trail, rather than making my own path)*.

But then I'd always find really hard to adapt myself to such things I and mistakenly saw as **good**, then feeling bad because of such failed attempts, and then being drawn back with an inmense force to the things I mistakenly saw as **bad**, but weren't bad, just were the things most like me, that I forced myself to see as bad just trying to fit in, live up to the expectations of others, and living the lives of others.

**The solution of these issues can come down to, trying to ignore the most obnoxious broken moral or social imperatives** *(self-fulfillment, at the cost of possibly not being what others and society defines as good, or acceptable)*, **trying to be and live with who you are** *(not shaping your life to the lives of others, their ideas of success or what they perceive as good or acceptable)*, **and not trying to be and live up to what others want you to be and live up to** *(not shaping your life according to the pressure coming from their expectations, living up to what you, and not others, want of yourself)*.
