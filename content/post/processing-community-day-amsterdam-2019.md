I presented my work made on **CraZe** in the **[Processing Community Day, Amsterdam](https://creativecoding.community/amsterdam)** edition. It was a very interesting experience because I got to meet a booming creative coding community which I didn't know about before, and because the things I presented were things I had been working on for years but had never properly presented to an audience.

[This is the presentation I made](https://speakerdeck.com/zubie7a/craze). I got great feedback, questions, and most importantly the people I met were very inspiring because the great and curious things they do. Despite it being a cloudy day, I felt very fulfilled.
