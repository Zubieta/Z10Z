I presented my work made on **CraZe** in the **Processing Community Day, Amsterdam** edition. It was a very interesting experience because I got to meet a booming creative coding community which I didn't know about before, and because the things I presented were things I had been working on for years but never properly presented to an audience.

This is the presentation I made. I got great feedback, questions, and most importantly the people I met were very inspiring because the great and curious things they do.
