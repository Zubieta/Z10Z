After my second internship at **Google**, and the months-long _very_ convoluted _conversion_ process that followed with a lot of back and forth that didn't seem to be going anywhere, I decided that it was enough and started looking for new opportunities.

I applied to many companies, but there was one that went through the whole process, and it was [Booking.com](Booking.com).

The process was surprisingly fast, from the moment I had my on-site interviews until the moment I started working, it was only 4 months. I did my interviews on **February 20th**, I got my offer on **March 3rd**, I had my appointment for the visa on **April 4th**, and I arrived to Amsterdam on **April 26th**, ready to start working on **May 1st**.

I had lived a few months in the US during my internships, but this was my **first time** in **Europe**, a whole new frontier, it feels like living on a different planet _(specially because the time-zone differences with my parents)_.

When I came for my on-site interviews _(which they covered the flights for)_, I was willing to make the most of this trip, and asked them to put my return flight for a couple weeks later so I could travel around **which they agreed with**! Because of this I was able to experience not only **Amsterdam** for a couple days, but then I traveled with a friend who lives in this side of the world to **Bruges**, then to **Paris**, then I visited my cousin in **Barcelona**, and then visited another friend in **Berlin**. This was a crazy way to kick-off my arrival to Europe!
