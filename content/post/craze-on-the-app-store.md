<center>**CraZe** is finally available on the **[App Store][02]**!</center>

After lots of **crazy** and **intense** moments this year, I got enough momentum to start learning **Swift** from scratch, and playing around a lot with it _(it is quite a nice language!)_.

Development started in **August**, and by **October** 80% was done, however I had to stop development for a couple months, but now I poured all my energy this last weekend into finishing the final stretch and finally publishing the first version!

There's lot of rough edges and things to improve, and functionality that still has to be ported from the **[Android][04]** version _(which was released in 2018)_, but rather than holding its release indefinitely until the app reached an _"ideal"_ state _(spoiler alert, there's always something to improve or new ideas to add)_, so I decided to release this first working version and then **iterate** over it over time with my own ideas and the **feedback** from others.

<center>I hope you enjoy it!</center>
<center>Please share images with **#CraZeApp** so others can find them,</center>
<center>You are awesome!</center>
