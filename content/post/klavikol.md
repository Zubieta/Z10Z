<center>This is the most sloppy version of the intro of **Muse**'s song _'Explorers'_, played of course, by me.</center>

This is part of my **Computer Graphics** class' project. It's using the **[Processing](https://processing.org)** programming language, the **[TheMidiBus](https://github.com/sparks/themidibus)** library, and a **[KORG nanoKEY](https://www.korg.com/nl/products/computergear/nanokey2/)** as input. 


The triangle changes its size according to the pitch of the key, and the color its brighter if the key is pressed hard, if not, it will be pale in color. Also, each note has its own color across the hue spectrum, going from Red to Red _(mapped to musical notes, from C to C)_. I used my own matrix transformations because part of the course is learning how to implement them.

After the input and basic 2D/3D transforms work with the visualization, it's time to try doing some more psychedelic visualizations of the music being played!

<center>Again, a very sloppy rendition of **Beethoven**'s _"5th Symphony"_, played by me.</center>

Now this is a different visualization. Instead of triangles, arcs are drawn for the duration of the key press, and with the key color. Also the further away from the center the arc is, the higher the pitch of the note, so same notes with different pitches are distinguishable visually. The star field in the background is a really nice effect I made myself too.


In the end, the visual keyboard will be optional, to focus completely on the visualizations and how they are influenced by the music, possibly getting some musicians potentially interested in using such visualizations for some of their performances!
As for the music, I suck as a musician, this is the most sloppy version of Muse's song 'Explorers' intro, played of course, by me
