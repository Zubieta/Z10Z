You know, one thing that human society as a whole can agree with, is that **[2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020)** has been awful, I don't think it's necessary to explain all the reasons why.

I have been "working from home" since **March**. Some people would think that being able to completely work from home is cool, but not necessarily. Even people who are full-time remote workers need some space and time to go out, interact with friends, go to a restaurant, go to a movie, etc, many things that given the circumstances I haven't been able to do as much as I'd like.

**This is not normal.** I miss the people from the office, I miss commuting, I miss having , I miss randomly telling puns to my teammates and watching the reactions in their faces _(the worse the reaction to pun is, the better)_. Still, I'm privileged to still have a job and being able to do it wholly from home.

_However_, given that my job is related to a big company in the travel industry, the uncertainty of layoffs has been floating over our heads for some months now. More like, the layoffs are a **certain** thing to happen, and the company has officially announced it will **[impact 25% of the global workforce](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/bookingcom-is-laying-off-up-to-25percent-of-its-workforce-due-to-coronavirus-downturn.html)**, but there's no further information regarding how will this impact be distributed. I've been working here for almost 3.5 years, but I don't really want to lose my job.

Anyway, back to the issue at hand. The isolation is something that takes quite a toll on me. I love going to the **movies**, I love going to **concerts**, I love hopping on a train and going to **random places** in this country. Even if I have lived alone for nearly 3 years, I never really felt isolated. I had my time for myself at home, and then I also had time for others.

I've tried a lot of stuff. I have read books, watched movies, series, got lost in thoughts, went around walking alone.
