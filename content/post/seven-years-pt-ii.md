<center>_"Starting is easy, persistence is an art"_</center>

For a long time in my life, I just went with the current, taking whatever opportunities came available, but without much of an overarching goal and a plan to reach it. This changed last year with this deep discussion about things _**seven years in the future**_, which planted in my head the idea of seeking an ultimate goal, or at least find myself such a goal.

I've never been much of a person that plans long term, and starting to do so is not so easy at first. It requires structuring things, planning, but also being flexible because not all plans go along as intended.

Regarding learning stuff I've tried to be more focused on specific topics instead of being spread around many things, which always caused me to feel that I didn't learn well enough and just drop them. **Trying to learn everything causes me to learn almost nothing.**
