So, I'm fascinated by the numbers **7**, **2** and **1** quite a lot. Really. Also any of the multiples of seven, but not so much as **seven** itself and **twenty-one**, and the digits of that number, **two** and **one**, and then any number with a digits combination of **seven**, **two**, and **one**, for example **721**.

One day in school I was doing some math in my calculator, and needed the result of the **84/66** fraction. Instead by mistake I gave **81/66** as input. The result was `1.2272727272727â€¦` and I was like, wait, what? That number is so _cool_.

Then some seconds later I realized that **81/66** could be reduced to **27/22**, and I was like, _whoa_, I like these digits. 

<center>`27/22 = 1.227272727...`</center>

Talk about an amazing fraction.
