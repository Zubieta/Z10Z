Today I got accepted for an **Internship** at **Google** this summer! **This is so crazy**.

**I haven't yet come back to my senses**. There's so much I want to write regarding this, mostly about the process so far, which started on **September 12th** *(exactly 5 months ago!)* particularly because there's some people in my university afraid of applying *(even if university recruiters try to motivate people to do so)*, so I believe a personal account of the process so far *(regarding applying, the interview process structure, etc)* would be really useful and motivating for some people I know *(and perhaps some others I don't, which still may find this interesting!)*. Of course there's some details I can't talk about *(like specific interview questions or other concrete details of the process)* but in what I can talk about, I'll try to do my best.

The process is far from over, there's still the **Visa** thing, but as far as **Google** is concerned, I got past their interviews and their project matching, which makes me really happy and optimistic for whats about to come! Once the Visa process has finalized, I'll update this blog entry to detail very thoroughly what my experience of this whole process *(from the moment of applying to the moment of getting the visa)* has been!
