*‘Motivation may get you to take on a task or behavior that you don’t normally do but eventually that motivation will either not be there any more or won’t be effective.’*

*'I think many of us have a **will to overcome** existing habits and form new ones but we **lack the way to do so**. Too many distractions, too many opportunities, too many excuses.’*

*’Take a look at successful people around you. Ask yourself are they successful because of some outside motivation or are they successful because **they’ve made a conscious decision they’re going to wade through the muck to get what they want.**’*

*’**Focus** on being **disciplined** instead of **waiting** to be **motivated**.’*
