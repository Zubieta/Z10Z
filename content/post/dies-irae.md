*“… Shall consume the world to ashes”*

There are many kinds of music to listen while programming, sometimes I listen to some ambient sounds, or relaxed piano music, or soft vocals music, or classical music, or usually orchestral *soundtracks* from role-playing videogames, **when I desire to focus and not rushing things**.

**When its the opposite, and I need to do things fast**, I listen to some upbeat electronic music, or *soundtracks*, from either action/suspense videogames or movies, because of the feeling of urgency these cause, like time is running out, and something has to be finished before it runs out.

In this case, its a song that has both the kinda **calm** classical music part, but also an **explosive** beginning, it feels as an rush that lights every temper, kickstarts the brain, and then it calms down a *bit* to make place for a bit lengthy session of focus, only to start picking up again. The same structure and feeling could be said to be delivered by [**Carl Orff's Carmina Burana**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHBG_FeITBY).

Listening to music during a prolonged task, can be incentivating, it helps setting a rhythm, it alleviates monotomy, but I try to avoid music with much lyrics though *(at least that I can understand)*, since listening to them draws from your attention. T`hats why listening to your favorite modern band while programming can do not much good to your focus.
