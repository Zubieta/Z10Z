It was during a sort of deep talk at lunch with my teammates, that I had a deep discussion with **Hadi** about the future. I talked about the goals I wanted to reach, all the things I wanted to learn, but how far away or out of reach they seemed. He then told me something like

It was something like a **challenge** and at the same time a **promise**, an **expectation**, a **motivation**.

He's a person I've looked up to a lot since we started working together, and he's approximately that much older than me, so when that time passes it will be interesting to see if I'm sitting at that _"side of the table"_ where he was sitting, perhaps giving the same advice to someone sitting in the place I was.
